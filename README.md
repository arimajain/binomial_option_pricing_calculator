# ðŸ“ˆ Binomial Option Pricing Calculator

This project is a simple, self-contained Python script that calculates the fair value of an option using the **Binomial Pricing Method**. It supports **American**, **European**, and **Bermudan** options, and requires **no external libraries**, making it easy to use and portable across Python environments.

## ðŸ“š Background

An **option** is a financial derivative that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell an asset at a pre-agreed price (strike price) within a specified time frame.

### Types of Options:
- **Call Option**: Gives the right to **buy** the asset.
- **Put Option**: Gives the right to **sell** the asset.

### Option Styles:
- **European**: Can only be exercised at maturity.
- **American**: Can be exercised at any time before or at maturity.
- **Bermudan**: Can be exercised on specific pre-determined dates.

### Binomial Pricing Method:
The binomial model constructs a tree of possible price paths that the underlying asset can take. At each node, the value of the option is calculated using a backward induction method considering the risk-free discount rate and early exercise opportunities (for American/Bermudan options).

## ðŸ§® Features

- Works with **pure Python 3**, no external packages required.
- Supports all major option types and styles.
- Visualizes the **stock price tree**.
- Customizable parameters.
- Prints final option value and internal calculations (optional).

## ðŸ§¾ Model Assumptions

- No dividends are paid during the life of the option.
- Risk-free rate is constant.
- The underlying asset follows a binomial up/down movement model.
